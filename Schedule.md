(Sebastian + Jaime on Skype)

Main discussed points.

* The main goal is to study the stability of cold filaments
  through hot shock heated halo gas.
* We want to move from theoretical-analitycal insights to controlled
  experiments. From that we want so suggest possible impact on
  galactic populations.
* On of the possible main ingredients is the ionizing flux from the
  central galaxy. This flux changes the cooling function on its
  surroundings. There are preliminary studies already on integrated
  quantities for a MW like galaxy simulated using SPH [ Galaxy
  Formation with local photoionisation feedback
  I. Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6748). Is it due to different
  filamentary accretion?
* Observed signatures of filaments vs. simulations do not fully
  agree. It might be because the observed object is rather uncommon,
  it might also be the result of poorly understood physics of
  filamentary accretion. See [ A cosmic web filament revealed in
  Lyman-alpha emission around a luminous high-redshift
  quasar](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4469) 

For next week, S. will read about
    * Radiative cooling
    * Shock stability
    * Typical temperatures for cold and hot phases of the gas
